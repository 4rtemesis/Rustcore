-- Rustcore Verification: Self-Found certification (plan sections 6 and 19-28).
--
-- Phase 4 scope is only the start of the claim: when it begins, what baseline
-- it begins from, and whether a late start can still earn verification. The
-- direct restrictions -- trade, auction house, mail -- land in Phase 5 and hang
-- off this same track.
--
-- The track exists on every character but only carries a claim once Self-Found
-- is actually switched on. Until then it sits unclaimed at UNCERTAIN, which is
-- the one status Core will ever promote; starting it at UNVERIFIED would
-- permanently lock out a player who enables Self-Found at level 1 tomorrow.
