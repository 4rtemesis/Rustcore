-- Rustcore Verification: playtime continuity (plan sections 16-18).
--
-- The server's /played is the ground truth for how long a character has been
-- in the world. Rustcore accrues its own tracked time while loaded, and the
-- difference between the two is time the character was played without Rustcore
-- watching.
--
-- Reconciliation is cumulative from a single anchor rather than per-interval:
--   untracked = (serverPlayed - anchorPlayed) - trackedSinceAnchor
-- Per-interval deltas would report a false gap at every session boundary,
-- because the seconds between the last accrual tick and the actual disconnect
-- are counted by the server but not by us. Measuring against one fixed anchor
-- lets that per-session drift stay small instead of accumulating as violations.
--
-- The anchor is set the first time a record sees a /played reply, so everything
-- a character did before verification existed is grandfathered (plan section 4).

-- ── Requesting /played ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- RequestTimePlayed always prints the result to chat, and the printing goes
-- through the global ChatFrame_DisplayTimePlayed rather than through the chat
-- message pipeline -- ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter cannot intercept
-- TIME_PLAYED_MSG. The only way to keep our own polling silent is to replace
-- that global and forward to the original when the request was not ours.
-- hooksecurefunc is not usable here because it cannot suppress the original.
--
-- Arguments are forwarded verbatim: Classic and BCC call this as
-- (totalTime, levelTime) while retail passes the chat frame first.
-- Catch-all: filter the chat frames themselves.
--
-- Replacing ChatFrame_DisplayTimePlayed below is the tidy fix, but it only works
-- on a client that still routes the reply through that function, and it loses to
-- any addon that replaces the same global after us. Whatever prints the two
-- lines has to reach a chat frame's AddMessage to do it, so filtering there
-- catches the reply no matter which path produced it.
--
-- Matched by content against Blizzard's own localised format strings, so the
-- filter drops exactly the two /played lines and nothing else, in any locale.
