-- Rustcore Verification: difficulty certification (plan sections 7-12 and 15).
--
-- Two numbers describe a character's difficulty standing and they must not be
-- confused:
--   currentTier         the preset selected in the options right now
--   highestVerifiedTier the hardest preset Rustcore can still vouch for
--
-- Selecting an easier preset does not by itself destroy a harder certification
-- (section 8). The certification only moves down when an easier rule set
-- actually governs something that happened -- in practice, a death (section 9).
-- highestVerifiedTier only ever moves downward; no setting change can lift it
-- again (section 10).

-- Exception mapping (plan section 11) ----------------------------------------

-- exception is not a violation, letting it change what actually happened is.
--
--   DEATH_WITH_LOSS  the exception altered a death that would otherwise have
--                    taken items under the selected preset
--   DEATH_SKIPPED    the exception cancelled the death penalty outright
--   REPAIR           the exception permits an action forbidden at every preset;
--                    the violation is the action, not the setting
