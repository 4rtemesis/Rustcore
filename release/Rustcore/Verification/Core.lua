-- contents. Those are things Rustcore saw happen, they do not stop having
-- happened, and the status they cost is meant to be permanent.
--
-- The rest is not evidence at all but the absence of it -- chiefly how much of
-- this character's life Rustcore was actually running for. That is a
-- measurement, it is taken fresh every time /played arrives, and it moves in
-- both directions: play on with Rustcore watching and the unobserved share of
-- the run falls. Storing its verdict the way an observed violation is stored
-- made recovery impossible, because a stored verdict is precisely the kind of
-- thing that cannot improve.
--
-- So the two are kept apart. `track.evidenceStatus` is the sticky half, and the
-- only half anything writes to. Components registered here are the derived
-- half: each is asked for its own verdict on demand and none of them is written
-- down. `track.status` is the answer to "how is this run doing" -- the worst of
-- the two -- and it is a cache. Nothing consults it to decide anything, and
-- losing it costs nothing, because the next Compose rebuilds it from scratch.
--
-- Worst-of is what keeps the halves from contaminating each other. A tracking
-- gap closing again can never lift a violation, because the violation is still
-- sitting in evidenceStatus being the worse of the two; and equally, a
-- violation cannot make a closed gap look open.
